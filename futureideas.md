different terrain (snow, rocks, desert etc) with different wheel like tracks or skis that help you go faster in those terrains - zak
teleport item + trap (teleport to end of segment/teleport to beginning)
gates that require checks to unlock (in archipelago terms)


far future ideas:
currency and shops
have it be like a roguelike with a branching map. So you are biking from point to point. Teleport lets you fast travel to any point you've visited. teleport trap resets you to start point for that segment
