teleport item + trap (teleport to end of segment/teleport to beginning)
gates that require checks to unlock (in archipelago terms)

.fit file export
hr monitor support


far future ideas:
currency and shops
have it be like a roguelike with a branching map. So you are biking from point to point. Teleport lets you fast travel to any point you've visited. teleport trap resets you to start point for that segment
