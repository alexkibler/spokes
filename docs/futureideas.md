teleport item + trap (teleport to end of segment/teleport to beginning)
gates that require checks to unlock (in archipelago terms)



far future ideas:
currency and shops
have it be like a roguelike with a branching map. So you are biking from point to point. Teleport lets you fast travel to any point you've visited. teleport trap resets you to start point for that segment

bugs:
coasting still not working at 0% grade. and riding still way too easy at 0% but maybe that's a me problem?
coasting seems to work fine at -5% though.
